\subsection{Collaborative Plan}
\label{subsec:collaborative-plan}
Our plan to work together is to have a group meeting for updating progress and planning on Friday of every week.
Meeting with advisor on Thursday of every week.
If there is a need for absent, every person need to clearly state.
Each system planning will be plan as sprint with duration of two weeks per each iteration.
After every iteration, we will have a reflection on the first Friday after the end of iteration.
For meeting, everyone on the team has selected to have online meeting on Discord.
\\\\
On project source code management, we will be using Git Version Control System and using Github as
a remote repository.
The project source code will contain only system source code, game source code, document, report and report image only.
For game resources will need to be downloaded outside of repository.
\\\\
We will be using Cmake as a build system in order to allow any text editor to work easily and using clangd as a formatter
in order to have consistence coding style.
Using MSVC as a main system compiler in order to target Windows Operating System specifically.
Although, we allow any text editor to use within this project but Clion by JetBrains is preferred.

\subsection{Task Coverage}
\label{subsec:task-coverage}

\subsection*{Project Lead}
This is a person who will manage and plan the project.
The main task of this person is to create a systematic plan for project which is tangible and able to lead to finish product.
Not only that, this person also need to communicate and also contact insider and outsider as needed.
Also, this person must be able to understand every person on a team and be able to find suitable solution in order to make
the work go smoothly as much as possible.
\\\\
But since this team is a small team, the project lead must be able to direct the project direction and understand the image
of final product.
In order to direct the project to the most beneficial outcome for the team.

\subsection*{System Software Architecture}
This is a person who responsible for over system design.
The responsibility for this person is this person must be able to design an architecture which is
suitable for the need of the software and also create a good work environment for the team to work
with this system in the future.

\subsection*{Gameplay Design}
This person is the person whose responsibility is to design a game which can test the system
that this system is work as intended or not.

\subsection*{Game Software Engineer}
This is a person whose task is to implement the game according to gameplay design within the
structure planned by Gameplay Software Architecture.

\subsection*{Graphic Software Engineer}
This person is a person who works on creating graphic which has high fidelity and also work
on optimization the graphic section of the software such as GPU Memory Management.

\subsection*{Operating System Software Engineer}
This is a person who creates an Application Programming Interface (API) to communicate with
operating system safely and optimal.
Also, this person must ensure the software security and memory safety.

\subsection*{User Level Software Engineer}
This is who creates an API for user to write a software on this system.
The person in charged must be able to create a way that is easier to implement while
also easy to use.

\subsection*{Gameplay Software Architecture}
This person is a person who design a system flow of a game to ensure good user experience
and also optimal data flow within game system.

\subsection{Workload Balance}
\label{subsec:workload-balance}
    Since this project is really large and requires highly specialize personal.
    Each tasks got assign specifically intended for that person to be master of that aspect of the system.
    And each of the tasks have their own set of challenge and require very deep understanding that's mean
    every person got to have their own hard and easy task where on higher level management can be inferred
    as task is already balance because the need of specialty.
