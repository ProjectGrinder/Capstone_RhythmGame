\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In recent year, interactive media is found in various of places around us
such as games, visual effect in movies, application, or Visual Reality (VR)
with usage covers many field for example Virtual Reality as a recovery tool in a
medical system.
Because of this demand, the performance requirement is became more prominent.
But on hardware side, the story is flipped on its tail because the growth of performance
is less than the demand.
\\\\
The current trend of creating interactive media is using game engines such as Unity, Godot, or
Unreal in order to create this type of media.
But these system did not build with this general usage in mind but rather build for creating
game specifically hence the name.
Because of this, these engines might not suitable for widely use system with such high demands.
Many companies decided to write their own from ground up which led to slower development and
unnecessary cost.
\\\\
With these raise a question.
Is it possible to create a system where it can be used to generate such media and highly optimal
for various task while also remain highly optimize.
\\\\
In order to test the precision of such software, one of the good test is to create a rhythm game
since this type of media is force to have high precision input in order to provide good response
to user and make the impression better for user.
Since we need to check if the system is general enough, we will add a Bullet Hell game into the mix
because it will be able to prove the generality usage of the system.
Lastly, to check if the system is good viable on business standpoint, we will create this game
to compete in Game Talent Showcase by Thailand Game Association (TGA).
