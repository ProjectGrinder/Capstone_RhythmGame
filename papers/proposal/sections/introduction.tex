\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In recent years, interactive media is found in various places throughout digital society
such as within games, visual effects in movies, applications, or Visual Reality (VR)
with usage covering many fields.
For example, Virtual Reality as a recovery tool in a medical system.
Because of this demand, the performance requirements are becoming more prominent.
But on the hardware side, the growth of performance
is far less than the demand.
\\\\
The current trend of creating interactive media is using game engines such as Unity, Godot, or
Unreal to create this type of media.
But these systems weren't built with this general usage in mind, but rather were specialized for creating games.
Because of this, these engines might not be suitable for widespread everyday usage with such high demands.
Many companies decided to write their own systems from the ground up, which led to slower development while accruing
unnecessary costs.
\\\\
These situations raise the question â€” whether it is possible to create a system that can be used to generate such media
and highly optimal for various tasks while also remaining highly optimized.
\\\\
To test the precision of such software, a good test is to create a rhythm game.
This type of media is forced to have high-precision inputs to provide good responsiveness to
the user and make a better impression on them.
To prove the generality of the system, a bullet hell game is also added to the media to showcase seamless
integration between the two highly different logics.
Lastly, to check if the system is viable from a business standpoint, we will create this game
to compete in Game Talent Showcase by Thailand Game Association (TGA).
