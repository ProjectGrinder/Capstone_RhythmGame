    This project focuses on addressing the lack of a versatile and high-performance general purpose interactive media
    creation framework, which is important due to the prevalence of interactive media in academic and medical contexts.
    The objectives of this project are to analyze the limitations of existing game engine architectures, particularly
    in their usage of creating general purpose interactive media, as well as to explore alternative paradigms and
    finally develop a framework that can streamline its creation with minimal development costs and maintaining high
    performance and usability across various domains.
    To achieve these objectives, the proposed solution involves an operating-system-like game engine, integrating
    the Entity-Component-Structure framework with operating systems concepts, while utilizing aggressive C++ compile-time
    optimization to increase performance.
    \\\\
    The methodology will include C++20, DirectX 11, and Windows API to design and analyze the system, and
    GoogleTest to validate it.
    The outcomes we expected from this project are a proposal, a deliverable prototype, and a system documentation,
    which we expected will provide industrial benefits to future creations of interactive media.
